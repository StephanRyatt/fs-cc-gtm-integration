# Finsweet Cookie Consent GTM Integration

## 📝 Description

This repository provides a **fixed and enhanced integration between Finsweet's Cookie Consent script (****`fs-cc.js`****) and Google Tag Manager (GTM)**. It ensures that consent settings from Finsweet’s system are correctly mapped and pushed to GTM for compliance with **Google Consent Mode, GDPR, and CCPA.**

### Why This Fix?

By default, Digital Sparks' Cookie Consent Boost script (`index.js`) incorrectly linked `ad_personalization` to "Personalization" instead of "Marketing." Since this script **pushes consent updates to GTM**, incorrect mapping leads to **inaccurate tracking behavior** in Google Ads and Analytics.

This fix ensures:

- ✅ **Accurate Google Consent Mode behavior** – GTM receives correct consent signals for tracking.
- ✅ **Full GDPR & CCPA Compliance** – Prevents unauthorized tracking based on user consent.
- ✅ **Reliable Webflow + GTM Integration** – Ensures consent settings are correctly reflected in GTM, Google Ads, and Analytics.

## 📦 How to Use

### **✅ Option 1: Use jsDelivr CDN (Recommended)**

The easiest way to integrate this fix is by loading the scripts via jsDelivr:

```html
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanRyatt/fs-cc-gtm-integration/fs-cc-fixed.js" fs-cc-mode="opt-in"></script>
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanRyatt/fs-cc-gtm-integration/index-fixed.js"></script>
```

🚀 **Why use jsDelivr?**

- No hosting required.
- Fast, global CDN.
- Automatically caches the latest version when updated.

### **🔄 Option 2: Self-Host the Scripts (For Full Control)**

Prefer to host the scripts yourself? Follow these steps:

1. **Download the files**:
   - [`fs-cc.js`](https://github.com/StephanRyatt/fs-cc-gtm-integration/blob/main/src/fs-cc.js)
   - [`index-fixed.js`](https://github.com/StephanRyatt/fs-cc-gtm-integration/blob/main/src/index-fixed.js)
2. **Upload them to your own server**.
3. **Update your script references** in Webflow or your website.

💡 **Advanced users:** If modifying further, fork this repo and update your jsDelivr links accordingly.

## 🛠 How It Works

This integration ensures that consent preferences are correctly passed to Google Tag Manager (GTM):

```javascript
ad_personalization: window.FsCC.store.consents.marketing ? "granted" : "denied",
```

This prevents ad personalization from being incorrectly tied to "Personalization" and ensures only "Marketing" consent enables ad-related cookies.

Since `index-fixed.js` updates GTM’s dataLayer, **Google Ads, Analytics, and other tools receive the correct consent signals**, preventing unauthorized tracking and maintaining compliance.

## 📌 Key Fixes

- 🛠 `ad_personalization` now aligns with "Marketing" consent.
- ⚡ Ensures **Google Consent Mode, GDPR, and CCPA compliance**.
- 🔄 Fully compatible with **Webflow, GTM, and Google Analytics**.
